    <h2>Emergency Supplies</h2>
    <p>We will do emergency supplies but only if the medication is a repeat medication that you have every month. 
The pharmacist would need to have your permission to access your care records to see if this item is a repeatable medication then if it isnt we wont be able to do one</p>

<p>We would ask that if you have forgotten to order your medication in time or you forgot it when going on holiday to ring your doctor first to see if they can do a prescription first.
    Then send it to us using the site code FKA51. If they havent sent it by 17:00pm then we can do an emergency supply. 
    <b>Please remeber to order your medication on time and pack it before going on holiday, 
        each person is responsible for their own medication and making sure they have enough.</b>
</p>

</div>
      
       

<div class="prescriptions">

<h2>Prescriptions</h2>
<p>All patients are required to order their own medication at least 10 working days before they run out of their current medication so the Gp can
 sign off the request and send it ot us so we can take a good 3 working days to get it ready. You can do it by emailing the surgery, use the NHS app or other online services or by simply
coming into the pharmacy and drop the back of the prescription that contains the list of medication you are currently on with the medications ticked that you want order
and we then send it down to the surgery every morning.</p>
<p><b>We do not order a pateints medication for them over the phone 
as it takes 2 hours out of our time every day where we could be dispensing prescriptions. So please do not call us to request an order of medication.</b></p>

<p>Another to note if a patient has seen a GP and the GP was gonna send up a prescription after the consultation straight away this isnt the case. The prescription will not be there or be ready for a pateint 
    as soon as they leave the surgery. You must allow at least 2 hours before going to the pharmacy so we have chance to do a download of new prescriptions. If on the download the prescription isnt there, do not panic 
    it just means the doctor has not signed it off at the moment and may take another hour or so for it to come through. <B>If the doctor said itll be ready for you when you get there , most of the time that wont be the case.</B>
</p>
<P>By then if it still hasnt come through then by all means call up the surgery to get an update on where the prescription is , 
    before leaving a second time we may ask what medication it was you are expecting so we can have a look to see if the item is in stock so you arent waisting your time coming in and getting nothing.
</P>

</div>

<div class="stock">
    <h2>Stock and Suppliers</h2>
    <p>To note , we are not a medication warehouse so we dont hold every single medication in stock and becuase we are a small pharmacy we have limited shelving for our stock 
        so can only keep a certain amount of stock at a time before we ould reorder, so once its gone that day, thats it until the next day wen the stock gets replenshed by our suppliers.

    </p>
    <p>Another thing to consider , suppliers arent always reliable when delivering stock, there have been times where weve placed several big orders from them and they only bring us a couple of items.
        So when we order stock for a patient we have to allow at least 2 working days for the stock to arrive but cannot garuntee a 100% delivery from that supplier so its up to the
    patient in what they want to do.</p>

    <p>Also there are a number of medications that go out of stock regulary becuase the ingrediant to make it is unvaliable or theres a high demand for that specific medication accross the uk t
        that there comes a time where no pharmacy within the uk can get access to it , which is called a nation wide shortage. 
    <b>We cannot tell when a certain medication comes back into stock with suppliers so bare in mind it could take several weeks or months for us to be able to get a certain item in.

    </b> </p>
    <P>We often get emails through to say that a cetain medication has been decalred as a national shortage and we recieve a date of when we might expect the item to come back in stock. However 
        if its an item that is very hard to get hold then the due date could be extended and put further back so please understand its not our fault that we dont have the medication
        you need , its the simple case it being far too popular with others around the country that the warehouses and suppliers need to order more quantites in ,so that they can delivering
        to places like us so we can dispense to the pateints.
    </P>
